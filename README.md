#**Safe Mom: Predictive Machine Learning for Preeclampsia**
##**Project Overview:**   

>Safe Mom is a predictive machine learning solution aimed at helping expectant mothers and healthcare professionals identify the likelihood of developing preeclampsia during the early stages of pregnancy. By leveraging patient data collected during the eighth week, the model provides valuable insights to mitigate risks and improve maternal health outcomes.

##**Project Goals:**  

-*Predict early:* Identify the likelihood of preeclampsia at the eighth week of pregnancy.
-*Enhance care:* Empower healthcare providers to make informed decisions.
-*Improve outcomes:* Provide mothers with early intervention strategies for better health.

##**Key Features:**  

-*Machine Learning Model:* Utilizes advanced predictive algorithms to assess preeclampsia risk.
-*Patient Data:* Collects relevant health information, including:
Age, weight, and BMI
Blood pressure readings
Family medical history
Past pregnancy complications
